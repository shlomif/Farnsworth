here are the parts

Makefile      to build UP.y -> UP.pm
UP.pm         generated file
UP.y          source for Yapp version of compiler
compute.pl    runs parse tree directly
fasm.pl       assembler
fold.pl       constant folding (works on tree)
gen.pl        parse tree to asm code
go            quick test
machine.d     maps symbolic op codes to machine instructions
opt.pl        peephole optimizer
parse.pl      RecDescent parser
run.pl        runs assembled code
show.pl       display parse tree
up.pl         main for Yapp parser module

these are all built to pipe together...
